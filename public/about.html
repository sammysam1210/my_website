      <p> My name is Samuel Liu, and I'm currently a senior in UC San Diego. I'm studying Computer Science, and have been coding since my freshman year of high school, where I learned the basics of coding through Scratch and Java. I've grown to really like coding- especially in the end, watching it all come together a finished and polished product. Outside the world of CS, I enjoy playing sports, music, and teaching kids. I ran cross country and track in high school, and now enjoying playing basketball, soccer, and volleyball. I've played piano for over ten years, and guitar and cajon for four years. I've taught many kids throughout the years, at church, at English camps in Taiwan, and summer tech camps.
