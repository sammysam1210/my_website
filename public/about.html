      <p> My name is Samuel Liu, and I'm currently a senior in UC San Diego. I'm studying Computer Science, and have been coding since my freshman year of high school, where I learned the basics of coding through Scratch and Java. I've grown to really like coding- especially in the end, watching it all come together a finished and polished product. Outside of world of CS, I love to play sports and music. I ran cross country and track in high school, and now enjoying playing basketball, soccer, and volleyball. I've played piano for over 10 years, and guitar and cajon for 4 years.
